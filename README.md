# python-paper4-programming-drills
A curated collection of Python programming exercises completed for Cambridge International A Level Computer Science (9618) preparation. Each file is a standalone, exam-style solution written with clear logic, explicit variable handling, and structured control flow; aligned with Paper 4 programming expectations.


## Overview

This repository documents my structured practice for **Cambridge International A Level Computer Science (9618) — Paper 4** using **Python**. The solutions prioritise:

- **Exam-friendly clarity** (readable, step-by-step logic)
- **Explicit control flow** (no “magic” shortcuts)
- **Strong fundamentals** (validation, iteration, arrays, functions, OOP basics)
- **Standalone programs** (each task runs independently)

The collection represents **~45** progressively challenging exercises, from core programming basics to integrated exam-style problems aligned with typical Paper 4 themes (searching, sorting, and OOP fundamentals).

## Repository Structure

- **One file = one question**
- **No inter-file dependencies** (each program is self-contained)
- **Consistent style**: descriptive variables, clear input/output, and structured logic

This mirrors how programming problems are presented and assessed in the Paper 4 exam.

## Topics Covered

### 1) Programming Fundamentals
- Output formatting  
- Variables and data types  
- Arithmetic operations and type conversion  


### 2) Input Handling & Validation
- User input processing  
- Range checks and condition-based validation loops  
- Sentinel-controlled repetition  

### 3) Selection
- `if / elif / else`  
- Logical operators  
- `match-case` decision structures (where applicable)  


### 4) Iteration
- `for` loops  
- `while` loops  
- Counting, summation, and conditional iteration


### 5) Searching Algorithms
- **Linear search** (found/not found, index returns, counting occurrences, validation-driven searching)   
- **Binary search** (boolean result, index returns, boundary updates using LB/UB/MP on sorted arrays) 


### 6) Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble sort** (ascending/descending, swap + pass control with flags) 
- **Insertion sort** (typical Paper 4 sorting pattern, with controlled shifting and insertion points)  


### 7) String Processing
- Indexing and slicing
- Character checks and substring extraction
- Controlled logic (avoiding over-reliance on advanced built-ins)
 

### 8) 1D Arrays (Lists)
- Traversal using indices  
- Searching and counting  
- Min/Max/Average calculations  
- Duplicate handling and reversal  


### 9) 2D Arrays (Matrices)
- Row/column traversal  
- Structured data representations (e.g., records-style tables)  


### 10) Functions
- Parameter passing and return values  
- Modular decomposition  
- Functions operating on arrays  


### 11) OOP Fundamentals
- Classes with constructors, getters/setters, and validation-driven methods
- Object-based modelling of simple real-world entities (e.g., temperature, employees, tickets, games)  


### 12) Integrated Exam-Style Programs (Final Set)
The final set of questions brings multiple Paper 4 skills together—**validation + loops + arrays + searching + OOP methods**—to produce a few small “real-world style” console programs, such as:
- Ticket pricing with discount logic and repeated validation loops   
- A simple game/battle round using object methods and state changes 
- A quiz-style scoring system based on the number of attempts 
- A menu-driven shopping cart simulation (add/remove/discount/checkout) }  
- A phonebook/contact search over an array of objects (case-insensitive matching)

## Purpose

This repository serves as:

- A structured record of my Python programming progress for **Cambridge International A Level Computer Science (9618)**.
- A focused revision resource for **Paper 4** techniques, including **input validation**, **arrays**, **searching (linear/binary)**, **sorting (bubble/insertion)**, **functions**, and **OOP fundamentals**.
- A demonstration of exam-ready coding style: clear logic, explicit variables, and traceable control flow.
- A foundation for transitioning into more advanced areas of computing, including **software development**, **AI**, and **cybersecurity**.
